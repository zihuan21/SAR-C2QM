# SAR-C2QM

Compact-pol to quad-pol SAR reconstruction via a joint mathematical-physical-constrained multimodal correlation-preserving latent diffusion framework

## Open Source Plan

This repository will be progressively updated with the following components:

- [âœ“] 1. Conda environment configuration file
- [ ] 2. Autoencoder code
- [ ] 3. Autoencoder training code and hyperparameter configuration files
- [ ] 4. Multimodal correlation-preserving LDM code
- [ ] 5. Multimodal correlation-preserving LDM training code and hyperparameter configuration files

## Environment Setup

A suitable conda environment named SAR-C2QM can be created with:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
